These cogs focus on fostering connections between friends and family in small Discord servers. While currently tailored to my specific server's style, contributions to make them more customizable are welcome!

Automatically assign and remove roles based on specified holidays and events.

## SocialLink (WIP)

An in-server Discord game inspired by the Persona video game series that encourages users to connect with each other. It works by lightly tracking key events (e.g., hanging out in VC channels for a while) and then assigning points to their "connection."

- [x] /confidants command to list all confidants and their scores
- [x] /journal command to view a log of events that increased links between users
- [x] /rank command to see a leaderboard of who has the deepest connections with other users

<img src="https://github.com/zaneriley/discord-cogs-for-small-servers/blob/main/weatherchannel/cog-logo.png?raw=true" alt="WeatherChannel" width="300"/>

A simple command to display users' local weather together at a specific time. Currently, you'll need to load the locations in a `.env` file like:

```bash
WX_LOCATIONS={"San Francisco": ["weather-gov", "37.7749,-122.4194"], "New York City": ["weather-gov", "40.730610,-73.935242"]}
```

- [x] **Fetch Weather Data**: Retrieve weather forecasts from the WeatherGovAPI.
- [x] **Display Weather Information**: Show current weather for individual or all default locations using `!weather today [location]`.
- [x] **Set Weather Channel**: Designate which channel to post weather updates in.
- [x] **Scheduled Updates**: Automatically post daily weather updates at 6 AM Eastern Time.

Next:
- [ ] **Weather Alerts**: Incorporate weather alerts into the daily updates.
- [ ] **User Customization**: Allow users to customize their preferred weather information and notification settings.
- [ ] **Support Additional APIs**: Expand support to include more weather data sources for increased reliability and feature diversity.

## EmojiLocker

Keep your server's custom emojis organized and exclusive by controlling which roles can use them. Perfect for creating VIP perks or managing themed channels.

- [x] **Easy Emoji Creation**: Add new emojis by simply pasting an image URL, uploading a file, or copying from other servers with `!emojilocker create {name} {source}`.
- [x] **Role-Based Access**: Restrict multiple emojis to specific roles (e.g., VIP members, event participants) with `!emojilocker set {emoji1} {emoji2} ...`.
- [x] **Remove Restrictions**: Unrestrict emojis to allow all roles to use them with `!emojilocker unset`.
- [x] **Bulk Management**: View and manage all restricted emojis in one place with `!emojilocker list`.
- [x] **Admin Override**: Admins always retain access to restricted emojis.
