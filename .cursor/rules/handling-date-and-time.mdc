description: Vital rules and recommendations for handling date and datetime in Discord cogs
globs: *.py, *.json
---
- Always use UTC.
- Store all timestamps in UTC.
- Convert to local time ONLY at UI display time.
- Use date for calendar-based features (e.g. holidays, birthdays)
- Use dateime with UTC for event timing and timestamps.
- NEVER mix naive and aware datetime objects.
- When possible, always prefer to use date_utils.py (utilities\date_utils.py) functions.
